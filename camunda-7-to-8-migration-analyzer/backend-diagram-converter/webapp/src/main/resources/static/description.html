      <h1>Details about the Diagram Converter</h1>
      <p>
        The diagram converter converts BPMN diagrams for Camunda Platform 7 into
        diagrams for Camunda Platform 8.
      </p>

      <p>
        As there are architectural differences between Camunda Platform 7 and
        Camunda Platform 8, there are some situations where you have add
        additional informations to the converted process model before you can
        deploy it successfully, for example in Message recieve events.
      </p>

      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
        When you upload a file, you will see the process diagram with overlays
        from the property info plugin. This should give a first glance about the
        usage of execution and task listeners or other hidden configurations.
      </p>

      <p>
        After pressing a button, the results from the diagram checks are shown
        below the diagram. The results consist of
        <mark class="text-bg-secondary">INFO</mark> ,
        <mark class="text-bg-info">REVIEW</mark>,
        <mark class="text-bg-warning">TASK</mark> and
        <mark class="text-bg-warning">WARNING</mark> output.
      </p>

      <ul class="row">
        <li>
          <mark class="text-bg-secondary">INFO</mark> is just the feedback what
          happend during the conversion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <mark class="text-bg-info">REVIEW</mark> is a hint, that you should
          check the conversion result. Right now, there is only a simplified
          conversion of expressions available. Some results may not work in the
          Zeebe engine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <mark class="text-bg-warning">TASK</mark> is a hint that you have to
          change the conversion result or add additional information to make it
          working the Zeebe engine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <mark class="text-bg-warning">WARNING</mark> is a hint that you may
          have to do something in your process automation project. For example
          if an element of the original process is not yet supported by the
          Zeebe engine.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The results are shown in two different ways. By default the user
        friendly table is opened. As an alternative, a machine readable JSON
        format is available below.
      </p>

      <h3>Options</h3>
      <p>You have different options to use the online diagram converter.</p>

      <p>
        Pressing Check only displays the result of the check. The colors of the
        check results get applied to diagram as well. Blue for
        <mark class="text-bg-info">REVIEW</mark> , yellow for
        <mark class="text-bg-warning">TASK</mark> and
        <mark class="text-bg-warning">WARNING</mark>. As a rule of thumb, the
        more yellow your diagram gets, the more you have to double-check and
        amend the conversion result.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you convert and download the uploaded diagram, you will find a new
        file with the prefix c8-converted-&lt;original filename&gt; in your
        download folder.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can download the check result as a CSV file for further project
        management or effort estimation. The diagram is not converted.
      </p>

      <p>
        All messages from the check will be added in a conversion namespace to
        the converted diagram. As this is only available in the XML view, you
        add the check messages additional to the documentation sections of each
        element. It allows to see the messages in property panel of the Camunda
        Modeler or with the property info plugin as overlays in the diagram.
